<!-- Welcome to the COVID19 interactive analysis website. Here you can explore current data about the ongoing COVID19 infection that is gripping the world. You can find information about infection numbers, recoveries, mortalities, infection rates by population and so forth. Happy exploring! -->
John Hopkins University maintains a database of world-wide confirmed COVID-19 cases ([GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), [Dashboard] (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)). This dashboard lets you explore the data further by visualising data regarding the total confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and confirmed recoveries. These numbers can be seen nominally as well as relative to the country's population. You can compare these data across countries and you can fit exponential growth models to individual countries to see how the disease has spread so far.
