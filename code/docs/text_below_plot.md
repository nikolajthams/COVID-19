Johns Hopkins University maintains a database of COVID-19 cases. This dashboard explores the data further by visualising data for individual countries.

**COVID19 data:** Johns Hopkins University ([GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), [Dashboard] (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)). 

**Authors:** This dashboard was created by [Nikolaj Theodor Thams](mailto:thams@math.ku.dk), [Martin Emil Jakobsen](mailto:m.jakobsen@math.ku.dk), [Phillip Bredahl Mogensen](mailto:pbm@math.ku.dk), all PhD-students in [Statistics at the University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/). 

**Validity of data:** The situation on COVID-19 is developing rapidly, and we're vastly grateful for the work done by Johns Hopkins. While there may be misreportings in the data, they are often quickly solved. We do not provide any guarantees that the data matches local official reports exactly.
