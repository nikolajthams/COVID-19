_**May 24th, 2020**_ 
- Add smoothened version of _New Deaths_, to remove large weekday variations. Smooths data by a 7 day (backwards in time) moving average. Added as default plot. 
- Add default buttons to load geographic regions. 

_**April 15th, 2020**_ 
- Default show _Total Deaths_ instead of confirmed cases, since this is of more interest currently. 
- Change days since patient x to _Days since death number x_.
- By default show only data since _March 1st_, since many countries had little development prior to this. Can be changed by input or by dragging axes.
