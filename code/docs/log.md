_**April 15th, 2020**_ 
- Default show _Total Deaths_ instead of confirmed cases, since this is of more interest currently. 
- Change days since patient x to _Days since death number x_.
- By default show only data since _March 1st_, since many countries had little development prior to this. Can be changed by input or by dragging axes.
